This simple proxy currently only handles the GET method. There is no logic to handle anything else.
My implementation is currently ill organized. The majority of the logic is in the main method. It is
possible to seperate the code out into methods for readability. 

Strengths:

Simple
Fast

Weaknesses:

Only GET requests
HTTP/1.0 does not keep a persistent connection
Sites that auto redirect to https do not work
